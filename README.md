# intelligent_surveillance_system
Intelligent surveillance system will automatically recognise and tracking faces with the help of image processing.
This project is developed, by using python[Version 3.4.0] and opencv[version 3.4.0].

[Description]

Intelligent surveillance system has received growing attention due to the increasing demand on security and safety. The intelligent surveillance system is capable of recognizing faces in real time. The recent developments in sensor devices, computer vision, and machine learning have an important role in enabling such intelligent system. An application for automatic face recognition and tracking on video streams from surveillance cameras in public or commercial places is discussed in this paper. In many situations it is useful to detect where the people are looking for, e.g. in exhibits, commercial malls, and public places in buildings. Prototype is designed to work with web cameras for the face recognition and tracking system based on open source platform, OpenCV. The system is based on LBPH algorithm and abstracts faces Haar-Like features. This system can be used for security purpose to record the visitor face as well as to detect and track the face. A program is developed using OpenCV that can detect people's face and also track from the web camera.
